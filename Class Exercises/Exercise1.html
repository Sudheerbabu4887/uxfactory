    <h2>Inheritance in java</h2><br>
    <p>Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent
        object.It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
        The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
        When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
        Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class.If a class have an entity reference, it
        is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A
        relationship.Consider a situation, Employee object contains many informations such as id, name, emailId etc. It
        contains one more object named address, which contains its own informations such as city, state, country,
        zipcode etc. as given below.</p>

    <h2>MultiThreading in java</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads
        simultaneously.<br><small>Jan 2019</small></p>
       <p>A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both
        are used to achieve multitasking.However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a
        shared memory area. They don't
        allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than
        process.A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and
